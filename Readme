The program starts off with a login page and there are some pre-registered users who are registered as admins and they are only allowed to login and a cancel button is there to exit the program. Upon logging in there are 4 buttons to select from the first button is used to add a
new book by inputting the book name , book id , author and genre to sort the books. The second button is used to lend a book upon clicking that we can enter the book name , book id , publisher , author , date and name of the member borrowing it, it also checks if the book has already been lent in which case it does not allow the entry into the database. The third button is used to add the book back to the database and give the output that the book has been returned. The last button is used to change the admin if there is another librarian who wants to login using their account then they can do so.
